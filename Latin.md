# Latin

## Grammar

#### Inflection (L. "inflectere" → bend in, curve)
The modification of a word to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. **The inflection of verbs is called conjugation**, and the **inflection of nouns, adjectives and pronouns is declension**.

#### Conjugation ("conjoin" → to join together)

The creation of derived forms of a **verb** from its principal parts by inflection (alteration of form according to rules of grammar)


## How to parse a Latin sentence

* Word order doesn't matter
* You figure out what's going on primarily by word endings
	* Noun endings change with grammar
	* Verb endings change based on their subject

## Genders

Latin has three genders (like Spanish, French, etc.)

* Female
* Male
* Neuter

## Cases

Modifies noun endings

If active, it's the thing doing the verb.

> **puella** dormit - **the girl** is sleeping
	
puella is the *nominative subject*

> **puellae** dormiunt - **the girls** are sleeping
