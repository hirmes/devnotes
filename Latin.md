## Latin Grammatical Terms

### _Inflection_ (L. "inflectere" → bend in, curve)
The modification of a word to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. **The inflection of verbs is called _conjugation_**, and the **inflection of nouns, adjectives and pronouns is _declension_**.

### _Conjugation_ (L. "conjugare" → join together)
The creation of derived forms of a **verb** from its principal parts by inflection (alteration of form according to rules of grammar)

### _Declension_ (Fr. "decliner" → to decline)
Explanation 1: The variation of the form of a **noun**, pronoun, or adjective, by which its grammatical case, number, and gender are identified.

Explanation 2: The inflection of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and articles to indicate number (at least singular and plural), case (nominative or subjective, genitive or possessive, etc.), and gender. A declension is also a group of nouns that follow a particular pattern of inflection.

## How to parse a Latin sentence

* Can't rely on word order
* Articles and pronouns are often implied rather than explicit

> Est charta parva → "Is" "map" "small" → It is a small map

* You figure out what's going on primarily by word endings
	* Noun endings change with grammar
	* Verb endings change based on their subject


### Number

Singular nouns that end in `-a` turn to `-ae` when plural

Verbs and adjectives will match the number of the subject noun
